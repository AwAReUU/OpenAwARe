# Code Coverage
> What code is covered by our unit/Unity tests?


## View code coverage results

In order to view the code coverage of our tests, a local copy of this folder is needed.
If you have one, simply open the index.html or index.htm file in the report folder.

## Run code coverage

Generating new code coverage reports is done via the Unity editor. In the navigation bar at the top, press window -> analysis -> Code coverage. This will open up a code coverage window. The test runner needs to be opened too. To do this, head over to window -> general -> test runner.

To actually generate a report, press the start recording button in the code coverage window. After this, run all tests that you want to include in the coverage report. Next, stop the recording. It should start generating a report. If this it is finished, the corresponding folder will open.
